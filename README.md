# 🎮 Snap

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This is a CLI-based game written in Java.

Snap is a classic card game where **two players take turns drawing cards** until **two consecutive card symbols match**. Players must **type 'snap' within 2 seconds** to win the round.

**This project helped me **improve my Java skills**, including:**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Loops & Conditional Logic**
- **User Input Handling**
- **Code Refactoring & Clean Design**
- **Game Design**

## 🚀 **Features**
- ✅ **Classic snap card game**
- ✅ **Single & Multiplayer modes**
- ✅ **Reaction-time based SNAP challenge**
- ✅ **Deck management** (shuffling, sorting by value, sorting by suit)
- ✅ **Replay functionality**
- ✅ **Fully modular OOP design with best practices**
